/*
 Think about it , If in the future you have specific configuration that is not connected to the database , you have a place to put it

for example , as you mature you often work with external services (API)

companies will give you tokens or secret keys that you need to reference in your code .


 There would be good place to declare it ,
 because remember those tokens and secrets again will often be unique
dependent upon whether youâ€™re in a local setting or a production setting
